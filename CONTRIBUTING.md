# Distribution & Addon Guidelines for Arda's Sculks

If you want to create content or contribute to **Arda's Sculks**, please follow these rules:

## No Re-uploading
You are **NOT** allowed to re-upload the entire mod or a slightly modified version of it as a standalone project. Distributing the mod's original files on any platform under a different project page is strictly prohibited.

## Contributions & Pull Requests
I do **NOT** accept direct Pull Requests or code merges into this main repository at this time. This is to ensure the security and integrity of the original source code. All official updates will be handled exclusively by me.

## Versions, Ports, and Loaders
If you wish to port this mod to a different Minecraft version (e.g., 1.21.8+), a different Mod Loader (e.g., Fabric, Quilt), or a different platform:
* **Standalone Addons/Ports**: You must release your port as a separate "Addon" or "Port" project.
* **Credit the Author**: You **MUST** add **Arda (IxraPlayer)** to the **Authors/Credits** section of your project page.
* **Link Back**: You must provide a prominent link to this original GitHub repository in your project description.
* **No Official Claim**: You cannot claim your port is an "Official" version; it must be clearly labeled as a "Community Port."

## Addons
I highly encourage creating **addons**! If you build a mod that requires Arda's Sculks to function:
* **Dependency**: You must list this mod as a mandatory dependency. Users should be directed to download the base mod from the official source.
* **No Bundling**: Do not bundle my original files or code inside your addon download.

## General Rules
* You cannot claim the original assets, code, or ideas as your own.
* Any work based on this project must remain open-source under the **LGPL-2.1 License**.

*Respect the original work and keep the sculk growing!*
