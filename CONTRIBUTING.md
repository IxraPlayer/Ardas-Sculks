# Distribution & Addon Guidelines for Arda's Sculks

If you want to create content or contribute to **Arda's Sculks**, please follow these rules:

## No Re-uploading
You are **NOT** allowed to re-upload the entire mod or a slightly modified version of it as a standalone project. Distributing the mod's files (original or slightly tweaked) on any platform under a different project page is strictly prohibited.

## Pull Requests (Contributions)
I accept Pull Requests under the following specific condition:
* **MCreator Compatibility**: All contributions **MUST** be developed using **MCreator**. This is required so that when I sync the files, I can see and edit the changes directly within the MCreator workspace interface.

## Versions, Ports, and Loaders
If you wish to port this mod to a different Minecraft version (e.g., 1.21.8+), a different Mod Loader (e.g., Fabric, Quilt), or a different platform:
* **Fork & Submit**: You must fork the repository and perform the porting work there. To have your version included, you must submit a Pull Request.
* **Official Hosting**: Upon approval, your work will be integrated into this official repository as a **separate branch** (e.g., `1.19.2-port`) to be hosted under the main project.
* **Official Release**: You are **NOT** allowed to publish these ports independently on platforms like CurseForge or Modrinth. All official releases must be centralized through this project/account.
* **Ownership & Credits**: Your contribution will be acknowledged in a "Contributors" list, but official ownership and authorship of the project remain exclusively with Arda (IxraPlayer). By submitting a contribution, you agree that you do not gain any legal rights or "Main Author" status over the project.

## Addons
I encourage creating **addons**! If you build a mod that requires Arda's Sculks to function:
* **Dependency**: You must list this mod as a mandatory dependency. 
* **No Bundling**: Do not bundle my original files inside your addon download. Users must download the base mod from the official source.

## General Rules
* You cannot claim the original assets, code, or ideas as your own.
* Any work based on this project must remain open-source under the **LGPL-2.1 License**.

Respect the original work and keep the sculk growing!
