# Distribution & Addon Guidelines for Arda's Sculks

If you want to create content or ports for **Arda's Sculks**, please follow these rules:

## No Re-uploading
You are **NOT** allowed to re-upload the entire mod or a slightly modified version of it as a standalone project without following the porting rules below.

## Contributions & Pull Requests
I do **NOT** accept direct Pull Requests or code merges into this main repository. This is to ensure the security and integrity of the original source code. All official updates for this main branch will be handled exclusively by me.

## Versions, Ports, and Loaders
If you wish to port this mod to a different Minecraft version (e.g., 1.21.8+), a different Mod Loader (e.g., Fabric, Quilt), or a different platform:
* **Full Port Releases**: You are allowed to publish the full ported version of the mod on your own project pages.
* **Mandatory Credit**: You **MUST** add **Arda (IxraPlayer)** to the **Authors/Credits** section of your project (e.g., on CurseForge, Modrinth, or GitHub).
* **Link Back**: You must provide a prominent link to this original GitHub repository in your project description.
* **Labeling**: The project must be clearly labeled as a "Port" of the original work by IxraPlayer.

## Addons
I encourage creating **addons**! If you build a mod that requires Arda's Sculks to function:
* **Dependency**: You must list this mod as a mandatory dependency.
* **No Bundling**: Do not bundle my original files inside your addon download unless it is a full port as described above.

## General Rules
* You cannot claim the original assets, code, or ideas as your own.
* Any work based on this project must remain open-source under the **LGPL-2.1 License**.

*Respect the original work and keep the sculk growing!*
