# Distribution & Addon Guidelines for Arda's Sculks

If you want to create content, ports, or contribute to **Arda's Sculks**, please follow these rules:

## No Re-uploading
You are **NOT** allowed to re-upload the entire mod or a slightly modified version of it as a standalone project without following the rules below.

## Pull Requests (Contributions)
I accept Pull Requests under the following specific condition:
* **MCreator Compatibility**: All contributions **MUST** be developed using **MCreator**. This is required so that when I sync the files, I can see and edit the changes directly within the MCreator workspace interface. 

## Addons, Ports, and Modified Versions
I encourage expanding the Sculk ecosystem! If you want to port the mod or create an integration:

* **Version & Platform Ports**: If you want to port this mod to a different Minecraft version (e.g., 1.21.8+), a different Mod Loader (e.g., Fabric, Quilt), or a major platform port (e.g., Minecraft Bedrock Edition):
    * **Credit the Author**: You **MUST** add **Arda (IxraPlayer)** to the **Authors/Credits** section of your project.
    * **Link Back**: You must provide a clear link to this original GitHub repository in your description.
* **Addons**: For mods that require Arda's Sculks to function, you must list this mod as a mandatory dependency. Do not bundle my original files inside your download.
* **License Compliance**: Any modified version or port must remain open-source under the **LGPL-2.1 License**.

## General Rules
* You cannot claim the original assets, code, or ideas as your own.
* If you release a ported or modified version on platforms like CurseForge or Modrinth, the project description must clearly state that it is a "Port" or "Modified version" of the original work by IxraPlayer.

*Respect the original work and keep the sculk growing!*
